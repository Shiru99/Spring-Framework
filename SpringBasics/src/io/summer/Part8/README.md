## ApplicationContextAware Interface

In Spring beans, you might require access to the ApplicationContext. For example, if your bean needs to look up some other beans. Similarly, if your bean needs access to some application file resource in your bean or even publish some application events, you need access to the ApplicationContext.

Spring provides an ApplicationContextAware interface that allows beans access to the ApplicationContext. This interface provides a single setApplicationContext method.
