## Spring Bean Factory

A BeanFactory is like a factory class that contains a collection of beans. The BeanFactory holds Bean Definitions of multiple beans within itself and then instantiates the bean whenever asked for by clients. The BeanFactory is the actual container which instantiates, configures, and manages a number of beans.
