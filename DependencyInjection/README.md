### Dependancy Injection

dependency injection is a technique whereby one object (or static method) supplies the dependencies of another object. A dependency is an object that can be used (a service).

When class A uses some functionality of class B, then its said that class A has a dependency of class B. In Java, before we can use methods of other classes, we first need to create the object of that class (i.e. class A needs to create an instance of class B). So, transferring the task of creating the object to someone else and directly using the dependency is called dependency injection.
